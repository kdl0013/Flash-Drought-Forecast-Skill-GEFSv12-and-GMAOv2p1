# This code was for a research project entitled "Subseasonal forecast skill of evaporative demand, soil moisture, and flash drought onset from two dynamic models over the contiguous United States". 

## If you want to re-run everything, please follow the order of the .sh scripts below. As a side note, I was running different parts of the scripts in different locations (like an HPC, home comp, work comp) because of several issues. So this code isn't fully optimized but it does have the code for the manuscript figures and analysis.

### There are also some scripts to directly download raw data from source

### There are scripts which are for downloading data and located in directory [download_data] (https://github.com/kdl0013/Flash-Drought-Forecast-Skill-GEFSv12-and-GMAOv2p1/tree/main/download_data)
